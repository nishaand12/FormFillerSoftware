### Step 5: Grant Microphone Permission ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**This is the missing step that caused silent recordings!**

When you try to start recording, macOS SHOULD show a permission dialog:
- "Physio Clinic Assistant would like to access the microphone"
- Click "Allow" or "OK"

**If NO dialog appears (unsigned app issue):**
1. Go to: **System Preferences** (or **System Settings** on newer macOS)
2. Navigate to: **Privacy & Security** ‚Üí **Microphone**
3. Find "Physio Clinic Assistant" or "PhysioClinicAssistant" in the list
4. **Enable the checkbox** next to it

open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Microphone"
```

2. Enter patient name
3. Click "Start Recording"
4. **Speak into microphone** - say test words clearly
5. Click "Stop Recording"
6. Recording queues for background processing

### Step 7: Verify Recording Works
After stopping recording:
1. Check `~/Library/Application Support/PhysioClinicAssistant/data/YYYY-MM-DD/PatientName_HHMMSS/`
2. Find `recording.wav`
3. **Test audio:** Open file and verify it plays back your voice
4. Check `transcript.txt` - should contain your spoken words (not just "you")

### Step 8: Check Background Processing
1. Wait a few minutes for transcription
2. Refresh the appointments list
3. Check transcript file again
4. If forms were selected, they should appear in the folder

## Troubleshooting

### Silent Recordings (All Zeros)

2. Find and enable "Physio Clinic Assistant"
3. Restart the app

### No Permission Dialog

**Cause:** 
- Microphone permission not granted
- Or pvrecorder not initialized

**Solution:**
1. Grant microphone permission
2. Click "Refresh" button next to device dropdown
3. Restart app if needed
