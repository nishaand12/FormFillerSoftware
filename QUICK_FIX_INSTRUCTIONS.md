# üöÄ Quick Fix: Enable Microphone Recording (5 Minutes)

## The Problem
Your app can't record audio when launched normally because it's not code-signed, which prevents macOS from showing the microphone permission dialog.

## The Solution
Ad-hoc code signing (FREE, no Apple Developer account needed).

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sign Your Existing App

```bash
cd /Users/nishaan/Documents/Development/FormFillerSoftware

# Sign the app in dist folder
./sign_app.sh dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app
```

**What this does:**
- Removes quarantine attributes that block permissions
- Signs all libraries inside the app
- Adds entitlements for microphone access
- Makes the app trusted enough to show permission dialogs

**Expected output:**
```
üîê Ad-hoc code signing: dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app
1Ô∏è‚É£  Removing quarantine attributes...
2Ô∏è‚É£  Signing embedded libraries...
3Ô∏è‚É£  Signing main executable...
4Ô∏è‚É£  Signing app bundle...
5Ô∏è‚É£  Verifying signature...
‚úÖ Ad-hoc signing complete!
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Move App to Applications (Recommended)

```bash
# If the app is not already in Applications
cp -R dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app /Applications/
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the App Properly (First Time Only)

**IMPORTANT:** On first launch, you MUST right-click ‚Üí Open

1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to `/Applications`
3. Find `PhysioClinicAssistant.app`
4. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on the app
5. Select **"Open"** from the menu
6. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog

**Why this is needed:**
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned/ad-hoc signed apps on first launch
- Right-click ‚Üí Open bypasses this one-time restriction
- After first successful launch, you can open normally

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test Recording

1. App should open successfully
2. Enter a patient name
3. Select your microphone from the dropdown
4. Click **"Start Recording"**
5. **THIS TIME** you should see: "PhysioClinicAssistant would like to access the microphone"
6. Click **"Allow"**
7. Speak clearly into the microphone
8. Click **"Stop Recording"**

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify It Worked

```bash
# Check the recorded audio file
# It should be in: ~/Library/Application Support/PhysioClinicAssistant/data/
# Find today's date folder, then your appointment folder
# Play the audio file - you should hear your voice!

# Quick check:
ls -lh ~/Library/Application\ Support/PhysioClinicAssistant/data/*/*/recording.wav
```

**The audio file should:**
- Be more than a few KB in size (silence is tiny)
- Play back your voice when opened
- Generate a transcript with your actual words

---

## üéØ Quick Verification

### Test 1: Is the app signed?
```bash
codesign --verify --verbose dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app
# ‚úÖ Should say: "valid on disk"
```

### Test 2: Does it have microphone entitlements?
```bash
codesign -d --entitlements :- dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app | grep audio
# ‚úÖ Should show: com.apple.security.device.audio-input
```

### Test 3: Check System Preferences
```bash
open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Microphone"
```
- ‚úÖ Look for "PhysioClinicAssistant" in the list
- ‚úÖ Make sure it's checked/enabled

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Permission Denied" when running sign_app.sh
```bash
chmod +x sign_app.sh
./sign_app.sh dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app
```

### Problem: App says "damaged and can't be opened"
```bash
xattr -cr dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app
# Then try opening again with right-click ‚Üí Open
```

### Problem: Still no permission dialog after signing
```bash
# Reset the permission system for your app
tccutil reset Microphone com.physioclinic.assistant

# Try recording again - dialog should appear
```

### Problem: App not in System Preferences ‚Üí Microphone
1. Make sure you launched the app at least once
2. Make sure you clicked "Start Recording" at least once
3. Restart the app
4. Try recording again

## üîÑ Future Builds

For all future builds, use the updated build script:

```bash
# This now includes automatic ad-hoc signing
python3 build_mac.py
```

The updated `build_mac.py` will:
- ‚úÖ Automatically do ad-hoc signing
- ‚úÖ Include entitlements
- ‚úÖ Remove quarantine attributes
- ‚úÖ Create a properly signed DMG

---

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Ran `./sign_app.sh dist/PhysioClinicAssistant.app` successfully
- [ ] App opens when right-clicked ‚Üí Open
- [ ] Microphone permission dialog appeared
- [ ] Clicked "Allow" on the permission dialog
- [ ] Recorded a test message
- [ ] Audio file contains actual speech (not silence)
- [ ] App appears in System Preferences ‚Üí Microphone
- [ ] Transcript contains correct words

**Once all checked, your microphone recording is fixed!** üéâ

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If recording still doesn't work after following these steps:
1. Check the detailed analysis in `MICROPHONE_PERMISSION_FIX.md`
2. Run the debugging commands in that file
3. Check Console.app for TCC permission errors
4. Make sure no other app is using the microphone

**The most common issue is forgetting to right-click ‚Üí Open on first launch!**
